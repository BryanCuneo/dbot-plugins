# dbot-plugins
A small collection of AGPL-licensed plugins that I have written for my Discord bot framework, [dbot](https://github.com/BryanCuneo/dbot).

## The Plugins

### [Dice Roller](/dice_roller.py)
Roll dice in Discord. Included with dbot by default.
 * /roll 6 - roll a d6
 * /roll 3d8 - roll 3 d8s, see each result and the total

### [Magic: The Gathering](magic_the_gathering.py)
Utilizes the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) to provide an MTG card search.

### [Recurring Messages](/recurring_messages)
Allows you to schedule recurring messages to be sent at specific times on specific days. Included with dbot by default.
